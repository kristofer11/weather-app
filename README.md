# WeatherMIO

## Features

AsyncPaginate is used to receive user input and give suggestions to the user for cities to select.

The GeoDB Cities API is used to retrieve a list of cities matching the user's search as they type.

Weather API is used to display current weather and forecast for the selected city.

FreeCodeCamp.org's "Build a Weather App" video has been very helpful. I basically started this project as a code-along with their video and have had some fun adding/modifying features.

** Note: Daily forecast has high temp and not min because api sends same value for both. Seems to be only high.
